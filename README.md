# ransomware-python
Simple ransom software using only Python for encryption
Today we will talk about how to create a simple ransomware virus or as it is known as ransomware that works on all systems
using programming, specifically using the Python language, where it will be able to work within the environment of Windows, Linux, Android and others, 
and we will write the code using Python language and make it encrypt all txt-type documents, and his work will be to go to these files and then open
them and then encrypt what is inside, and if I see your support, I will download an in-depth explanation about the ransom virus more.
